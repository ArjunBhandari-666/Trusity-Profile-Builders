<h5 style="font-size: 30px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Why do I want to make a beach cleaning robot?</h5>
<p>Many people litter at beach, and the pollutants float into oceans or seas harming aquatic animals. There are many companies trying to reduce pollution at beaches, but they are too slow and small for them to reduce pollution at beaches in their area. This why I think a development of waste cleaning robot is the next best thing</p>
